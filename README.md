# I made this only with CS:S in mind - I'm not sure if this style works in other games
This style ('Infinite') let's you jump in midair!! You can also fly through the start (bind mouse3 "say /nc")

This was an idea I had back in July, but never got around to making since I didn't own a CS:S server. Now I do, here's the source code!

Here's the style entry I use for Infinite:

````
	"12" // CHANGE THIS ACCORDING TO YOUR STYLE LIST
	{
		"name"				"Infinite"
		"shortname"			"INF"
		"htmlcolor"			"FF00FF"
		"command"			"inf; infinite; i; swagfuckingstyle"
		"clantag"			"INF"

		"airaccelerate"		"1000.0"
		"autobhop"			"1"
		"easybhop"			"1"
		"prespeed"			"1" // This allows you to fly through the start.
		"nozaxisspeed"		"0"
		"velocity_limit"	"0.0"
		"bunnyhopping"		"1"

		"rankingmultiplier"	"1.0"
	}
````

HF!
